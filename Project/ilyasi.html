            <h1>Ilyasi Mosque</h1><hr width=25%><br>
            <p> In Nawanshehr there is a famous mosque that was built over a stream of water that flows from the mountain. The mosque stills stands to this day and still has water flowing underneath it. It is called Ilyasi Masjid. In front of it is a little pond-like area in which people can ride paddle-driven boats.A trip to historic Ilyasi Masjid. Ilyasi Masjid, the oldest and largest Masjid of Abbottabad built over a stream of water that flows from mountain, has an attraction for tourists with spicy pakoras being sold like hot cakes outside the Masjid.<br><br>
            This striking mosque, which includes a complex of spring-fed bathhouses and pools, is 5km east on the Murree road, near Nawan Sheher village. A small bazaar nearby has basic teashops. Catch a Suzuki (Rs10 to Rs20) to Nawan Sheher from the Suzuki stand on Id Gah Rd.
            <br><br>The water of the stream which is said to have curative properties and serves as a cool drink on hot summer days made it a popular spot. As a public place, it offered business opportunities which a pakora maker exploited to full advantage. If you grew up in Pakistan you obviously know what a pakora is, it is the quintessential South Asian snack found in every street corner, whether its summer or winter.</p><br>
            <h2> Experience</h2><hr width=16%><br><br>
            <p> I was in a trance, a feeling that I had never experienced before. When I entered the mosque through a small gateway, I saw people sitting around with their eyes fixed on its facade, admiring its beauty and praying to God Almighty.

            The air was full of a sense of peace and tranquility, soothing the people who had come there to offer their prayers. As I strolled towards the front area of the mosque I was captivated by an unidentifiable force. Located there was a pond with fountains as high as hills. A small part held the ablution area.<br><br>

            Before me stood the glittering white snowy structure of the mosque. It seemed as if the entire facade was covered with snow like the high peaks of the surrounding areas. The exterior of the mosque has exquisite carvings that artists seem to have made out of sheer respect and love.<br><br>

            Amidst the hustle and bustle of vibrant bazaars, colourful shops and small tea stalls, I came across the striking and magical Ilyasi Masjid in Abbotabad.
            For a moment I could not take my eyes off the mosque with its white glittering magnificence, architectural beauty and imposing structure. I am sure that if you would have been there, you too would have been enchanted by it’s mesmerising, mystic and spell binding aura.

            Water from the ancient natural spring of Ilyasi Masjid is said to possess healing powers.
            Actually I was in search of something else there, something which my mother had told me to look for. A natural water spring which had been there since ages.<br><br>
            As I made my way up the staircase, I saw a stream of water coming out of a pillar-like structure. I stopped there for a moment and asked the women filling bottles from the water if this was the ancient natural spring of Ilyasi Masjid? When they answered in the affirmative I was awe stunned and at the same time delighted that I had finally got to witness the wonder about which my mother told me when I was a child. Trust me I had goose bumps!<br><br>
            I stopped there and felt the sweet and fragrant spring water for a moment and after ablution with the same went upstairs. There was a huge prayer chamber with a veranda outside it. The upper architecture of the mosque was even more stunning. One could sit there for days admiring the sheer beauty of the architecture, carvings and design, all white in colour.</p><br>

            <p>
            The Ilyasi Masjid is famous for having some of the best pakoras in Pakistan. The proximity of the Ilyasi Masjid is very convenient for travelers as it is on the road that leads to Nathia Gali. Travelers make a pit stop here before continuing towards their journey uphill.
