            <h1>Harnoi River</h1><hr width=23%><br>
            <p> Harnoi lake is a touring spot or you can say that a picnic place where you can enjoy children enjoy here and enjoy the flowing water of this little lake called Harnoi Lake And if you are planning for a Picnic with your family or with school trip and hurry up get pack you assentials to visit to this place.Pack your picnic essentials and have a fun filled day with your family.It is an emerging tourist spot because of the fact that it is very near to Abbottabad.<br><br> A few minutes drive from Abbottabad takes you to this place, evenings are very enjoyable as there is s lot of hustle and bustle.It is surrounded by the mountains.The crystal clear water stream and the lush green hills around add to the beauty of the area. There is also an amusement park at Harnoi.Harnoi, a famous picnic spot on the outskirts of Abbottabad, remains to be neglected by the authorities concerned. Located on the main Nathiagali Road, Harnoi is a small town situated on the confluence of two small rivers namely Harno and Barengali, about 10km northeast of the Abbottabad city. <br><br>
            The famous picnic spot is endowed with natural beauty and serene environment. Different species of trees dotting lush slopes of the adjoining hills and the cold waters of springs that flow down to this point makes it a major tourist attraction. Natural springs feed the rivers, which swell as the snow in the hilly ranges of Murree and neighbouring areas begins to melt. This small town, at 15 minutes drive from the garrison city is also known as the gateway to Galyat.<br><br>
            However, as is usually the case, the popular picnic place faces neglect from the authorities. Lack of attention and required investment is not only depriving the district’s exchequer of income, but also taking away the luxury of enjoying a “well-managed” and “fully developed” picnic spot from the visitors. Provision of facilities, including security and a hygienic eating place, would certainly help boost the popularity of the place.<br><br>
            Evenings at this point are every enjoyable, as there is a lot of hustle and bustle. People along with their younger ones can be seen enjoying the cold water. Some are seen splashing it on to their siblings, while others just standing in the river with their feet submerged in the water of the Harnoi River.</p><br>
            <h2> Experience</h2><hr width=16%><br><br>
            <p> The hoteliers and small kiosk owners have placed their stalls on the flow of the river that makes the picnic more fascinating for the visitors. “I spend hours sitting on the cots with my feet submerged in the water, it makes me feel as if I am sitting on ice,” said Deeba, a university student who claimed that she visited Harnoi with her friends daily in the evening. She said that since it was very close to the city area and the atmosphere is quite like Nathiagali, so she preferred to spend the time here.<br><br>
            Some families, cramped for time, just bring prepared meals from home and enjoy a nice picnic right next to the river. “A more organised way of doing things would certainly help, the way hotels and stall owners are going about their business is quite haphazard,” said Shariq, who was visiting with his family.<br><br>
            The Harnoi picnic point also offers fun activities for the children. The merry-go-rounds and other recreational fixtures are certainly the crowd-pullers among the younger lot. Horse rides for the children and even the youngsters is another enthralling activity one can enjoy here.</p><br>
